# Introduction

This document describes the evaluation of several web-based single sign-on solutions (SSO) for the authentication of user in internal web applications. In other words, you have a number of internal application and would like that your users only need to log in once instead of every application.

For the purpose of this document, SSO refers to the process of a single sign-in action that provides access to mulitiple applications (typically related but not connected). Think of signing-in once in the morning and access a number of appliactions afterwards without authenticating again until the session expires.

# Problem

While implementing a small web application in Python, I realise that I'm repeating myself when I wrote the code to authenticate users. Conseqeuently, I started looking at SSO solutions that would allow me to authenticate users in my own applications and ideally also for other web applications.

Let's try to break down the problem a bit further. We need a way to authenticate users (e.g. by username/password). After the scuessful authentication, we need to provide something to the user that the user can present in subsequent requests to differnet applications for the purpose of authentication and authorisation.

# Options

A Google search identified the following two options to implement SSO:
* [User Certificates]
* [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)
* [Authentication Tickets](http://www.openfusion.com.au/labs/mod_auth_tkt/)

## User Certificates

User certificates can be loaded into the user's web browser and presented to the web servers. The web server then can verify the certificate and authenticate the user based on the username in the certificate. 

This solution is secure and well supported in different web browsers and web servers. However, it only solves the authentication piece. We still need to implement access controls in every web application based on the username. We only know who the user is but not what she is allowed to access.

Theoretically, we could consider adding extensions to the certifacte that provide the information what the user is allowed to access like the group memberships. However, this would require the issue a new certificate and revoke the old certificate whenever the user's access permissions change. This would obviously create an administrative overhead.

## JSON Web Tokens

Defined in RFC 7519, JSON web tokens (JWT) are a way to present claims (e.g. user identity between two parties). This makes them an ideal way to implement SSO. The SSO server creates an identity claim, provides it to the client, and the client sends it to the web applications to prove his identity.

![JWT flow](https://github.com/m3ccanico/blog/blob/master/002/JWT-flow.svg)

Once the JWT is obtained, it is presented to the web server in the authentication header of the HTTP requests. Therefore, any client using JWT needs to be able to set the HTTP authentication header appropriately. As the web browsers do not natively support JWT. The JWT needs either be set as a cookie or the JWT needs to be received by a browser based client (JavaScript). 

As most modern web applications are JavaScript and API based, this is fine for such appliaction. However, it creates a problem to use the same method for legacy applications.

It is possible to set the JWT as a cookie in the web browser and get the client to send the cookie with the HTTP request. However, this either requires support in the web server to verify the JWT cookie or to be implemented directly in the web application.

There is currently only commercial Nginx module that support JWT in cookies ([JWT from a cookie](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_jwt_module.html)). Implemementing the JWT verification in the application negates the benefits of having a SSO solution that doesn't need to be implemted in every web application.

In summary, JWTs are a great solution for API based web application where the client can set the authorisation header in the HTTP requests. However, for legacy web applications (i.e. not Javascript based, or simple HTML sites) JWT are not simple to use.

## Authentication Tickets

Authentication tickets use, the same principle as JWTs. The authentication server creates a signed tickets, the application then uses the ticket to authentication against the application. The difference to JWTs is that the ticket is creates as cookie in the client's web browers. 

As the ticket is set as a cookie, not changes to the client is required. The client (i.e. the web browser) works at it normally would.

There are restrictions with cookies. A cookie can only be set and sent to a single domain. For example, if the authentication server is sso.example.com, the web applications can only be other sub domains like server0.example.com but not server1.example.org.

The current implementation in [Apache](http://www.openfusion.com.au/labs/mod_auth_tkt/) uses symmetric encryption to sign the ticket. Consequently, all systems need to share the same common secret to verify the ticket. If the secret is compromised on one system, the authentication for all web servers using the same secret is compromised. A attacker could use the shared secret to create valid tickets.

There is an alternative implementation that uses public keys (mod_auth_pubtkt)[https://neon1.net/mod_auth_pubtkt/] to sign the ticket. The implementation is not yet available as a package in Ubuntu or Debian. Therefore, manually compiling of the module on every web server would be required.

# Decision

Based on the above review, I've decided to use the authentication tickets (mod_auth_tkt). It strikes the right balance of effort vs. risk vs. benefits.

If you are very security sensitive, the mod_auth_pubtkt might be the better solution. If all your applications are JavaScript based, JWT is probably the way to go as it is standardised and supports strong encryption.

# Implementation

We wrote a small web server that authenticates username and password against LDAP (AD) and provides tokens to users in the form of a cookie. The cookie contains the access permissions of the user.

The cookie is validated by the Apache web server. If the cookie successfully validated and the user has the right permissions, access is granted to the web application.
